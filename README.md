#####  Finally I could enter by ruby (thanks god) and I hope my questions do not delay the class assistant.
##### Now, answering your questions:
    1. at the first part assign:
        - I realize there is an order from the hall page, to a single text inside.
        - each artile title is conforms from 3 parts. The name of the article identified by the ID where it comes from, then an informtation of the page, name call "athing"; second: the information of the article, like the points and comments; finnally a spacer for and space between the articles.
        - there is one that have a link reference, using href
    2. at this part I opended the sourses ant I realized that:
        - the hn foulders contain all the functions of the site, all the interactions with the users
        - the news foulders contains all the structures of the page, the weight, color, border, margin. This creates the visual compouser.
    3. I opened netword and the information is:
        - the requests are 7
        - 13.8 kb transfered
        - It download the texts of the page, the files of what we where watching before, the structure and functions. Also de icons.
